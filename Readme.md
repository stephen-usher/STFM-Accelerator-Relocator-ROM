This project is a PCB to allow two CPU sockets to be switched between on an
Atari ST.

It also provides a socket for a 512K ROM which can either be presented as a
single image or switched between an upper or lower image along with the logic
required to enable the larger ROMs, such as TOS 2.06 on a standard machine.

The ROM switching circuit was borrowed from Derkom (on the Exxos Forum) which
he used on his re-locator/switcher board for his STacy project.

The two sockets are identical so either can hold any processor which runs in a
68000 socket. On mine I currently had a stock 68000 in the "68000" socket and
a TF536 in the "Accelerator" one.

The ROM socket is compatible with the Exxos dual TOS ROMs.

P.S. There is another very important feature... there's a Turbo LED header,
which will light an LED if the "Accelerator" socket is in use.
